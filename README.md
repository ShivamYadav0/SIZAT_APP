[Vite](https://vite.org) is a next-generation Reactive Blockchain that adopts a _message-driven, asynchronous architecture and a DAG-based ledger_.
The goal for Viteâ€™s design is to _provide a reliable public platform for industrial dApps_, with features of ultra-high throughput and scalability.

### Faster ledger sync

[download](ledger_snapshot.md) gvite ledger file manually.

## Versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make a significant update of the protocol (like Ethereum, Ethereum 2.0 is rather a new blockchain from Ethereum 1.0),
2. MINOR version when you introduce some breaking changes, and
3. BUILD version when you make non-breaking changes such as bug fixes, RPC modifications, code refactoring, test updates, etc.

## Branching

The `master` branch is the working branch for the next release. 
- Breaking changes should not be merged into `master` unless as described below.
- Non-breaking changes should be merged into `master`.

1) A new branch should be checked out from `master` before releasing a new version. 
    - Say the latest version running on mainnet is 2.12.2, we can checkout a branch named `release_v2.12.3` from `master` for building, deploying on testnet, releasing the binary and deploying on mainnet.

2) A development branch for the next breaking changes, for example `v2.13`, will be checked out from `master`. 
    - Any commits from `master` are required to be merged into `v2.13` (or rebase `v2.13` onto `master`) as soon as possible. 
    - All unit tests and integration tests should pass before merging a pull request.

3) Merge `v2.13` into `master` and checkout `release_v2.13.0` from `master` before the mainnet upgrade. 
    - This means that v2.13.0 is the next release and there are no more releases of version 2.12.x. 
    - The branch `v2.13` reached end-of-life and a new branch `v2.14` for the next breaking changes should be checked out from `master`.
    - From this point onwards, any new commits which are merged into `master` are based on version 2.13.

Any changes should be committed to your personal fork followed by opening a PR in the official repository.
